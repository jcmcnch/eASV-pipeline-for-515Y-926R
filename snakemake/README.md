This workflow is in progress, and not yet ready for production...

Please continue to use the bash workflow until otherwise indicated on the base README.

Notes to self:
- For basic tasks can use wrappers: https://snakemake-wrappers.readthedocs.io/en/stable/wrappers/bio.html
- Examples: seqtk, blast, DADA2, cutadapt
- Check out also other example workflows for inspiration: https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/docs/all_other_workflows.html (search for `qiime2`)
-

Notes on configuration:
- Make sure to do the full snakemake install instead of "minimal"
